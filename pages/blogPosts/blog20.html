					<h1>My First Internship</h1>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						September 3, 2019

						<br><br>

						This past summer was a summer that couldn't have gone any better. I had my first software engineering internship. It was in April when I interviewed with a company, and then the last week of April, they gave me an offer. I had put in all this work to get an internship, and it had finally panned out.

						<br><br>

						I was ecstatic. I was nervous. I had imposter syndrome. What if I went there and looked like a fool? What would I be doing? They didn't really give me much information. Would I be doing web development? I'm not such a fan of that, but hey, an internship is an internship. About one month later, I started my job as a Software Engineering Intern at Zoro.com

						<br><br>

						I get there on the first day, and I meet with some members of my team. I meet with the head of engineering. He says to me a bunch of stuff about the company values, and everything is looking good. At lunch, they buy us food, and we talk about our project.

						<br><br>

						Our project is an Amazon Alexa skill to search for products from the website. When I heard about that, I thought that it didn't seem that hard. My imposter syndrome went away. This was doable. This was something that I was ready to attack, and something that I had wanted to do in my free time. It wasn't web development, too.

						<br><br>

						A day or so later, we had a meeting where one of the lead product managers gave us a presentation on Agile. It was specifically us interns that the presentation was given to, and it was in a very personable format, so we were able to ask questions and get clarification on different points. This was it. This was how professional software is developed. This was the goal that I wanted to learn going into an internship, and I learned it within a few days. This was the moment where I knew the internship was going to be great.

						<br><br>

						Fast forward 10 weeks and my internship was finally over. It flew by in the blink of an eye, and I had learned so much. I learned about agile, I learned how to abstract my code, how DevOps works, how to actually create a pipeline, and how to work with a team. I learned where struggles come using Git within a group, and how to resolve those struggles. I learned how different parts of the company interacted with each other. I learned what makes a company good, and what makes a company bad. I learned skills that developed me as a person, both professionally, and personally.

						<br><br>

						During the last week, we presented our project to the entire company. Yeah, they let us present this project to over 300 people. Our presentation was flawless, and people were coming to us throughout the day saying, "That was so cool!" and "Really great presentation guys!"

						<br><br>

						There's a sense of satisfaction gained when something like that happens. You can finally see the fruits of your labor. You can finally look back and say, "Wow, this was the coolest internship ever."

						<br><br>

						Of course, I couldn't have done it without my teammates, and mentors along the way. Even random employees were happy to help us. One guy even went out of his way to offer us specific workshops/presentations on certain topics just because he wanted to be helpful. It seemed like everyone here wanted to see you succeed, and that was such a nice change from the semi-competitive school environment. We were truly a company that would win and lose together.

						<br><br>

						The company wasn't even super uptight about most things. It was a company culture that felt relaxed. Talking to employees, they would say, "Not many other companies are like this," and I would totally believe that. It felt like everything had a place and everyone meshed together to create something great.

						<br><br>

						This internship put me in a completely different place than where I would be without it. I finally have something where I feel like I'm turning into a software engineer instead of just a programmer. It gave me a nice addition to my resume, and gave me the knowledge to succeed in things I do going forward. It's just one more thing that has told me that I'm on the right path.

						<br><br>

						Thanks Zoro
