					<h1>A Quick Little Wholesome Post</h1>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						November 28, 2018

						<br><br>

						Alright I have to start this one off by apologizing. I've been making these blogs just way too gosh darn depressing! That's not the vibe I'm trying to spread here! What kind of portfolio would this be if it just looks like I'm a sad boy all the time?!

						<br><br>

						So sorry about that. To make it up to you, I think I'm going to make this post a nice wholesome post. To make it up to you on me being depressing with my posts, but also because I'm not really sure what I want to write about this time, and if I start writing about happy things, I'm sure that it will turn out great.

						<br><br>

						One immediate happy thing that I can think of is how a company sent me a coding challenge today. By itself this isn't all that great, but there's a short story behind it. Last year I applied to this same company, and they sent a coding challenge last year too. Of course, being about a month into college when I took this challenge, I had no idea how to do it. I didn't even know how to get the input that they were giving with the tests. That's how bad it was. I didn't even know how to do the fibonacci sequence!

						<br><br>

						I didn't get the job last year. This year, however, it turns out that they sent the exact same coding challenge. I was kind of surprised that I recognized it, but it was the first coding challenge a company had ever sent me, and it was a traumatic experience last year so it left a mark.

						<br><br>

						The thing that makes this so great is that my response to the challenge this time was completely different. I actually knew how to do it this time! You have no idea how proud that makes me feel. It's moments like these in which you can see the progress that you've made in your life, and it just makes you smile. Maybe the hard work and effort is paying off!

						<br><br>

						Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the optimal solution for one of the four questions, but hey, there's always next year!

						<br><br>

						What other wholesome stories do I have to tell? Oh man, classes have been so stressful lately it makes it difficult for me to think of things that are actually going my way! No! I need to stop it with these depressing parts of the blog!

						<br><br>

						Let's stay completely wholesome.

						<br><br>

						I guess I can talk about how I started working out again. I've been off the schedule for a long time, but I think this is where I can get back into it. I've been waking up around 6-7 every day rather than sleeping in until the latest moment possible. It makes my day feel better.

						<br><br>

						What else? What else? I feel like a little puppy who is about to go for a walk! I just want to jump up and down and run around in circles! That's how wholesome this is all making me feel.

						<br><br>

						In fact, as I'm writing this, I have a big ol' smile creeping onto my face. It's mostly because I'm laughing at how ridiculous I'm being right now. I love being ridiculous! And hey, it makes amazing blog content, am I right?

						<br><br>

						Alright there's gotta be more. There's gotta! Oh there's one sitting right in front of me! This blog! That's something that has had a positive impact on my life. We're already on day 5! I look forward to writing a blog post every single day, and I think it will be interesting a year from now to see how far it has come. Do you think that I'll be able to blog every single day? Or maybe you're from the future and you already know the outcome. Well, if you are, you better not spoil anything!

						<br><br>

						Seriously though, I'm a bit surprised I haven't even come close to dropping a day yet. Especially with finals in less than two weeks, it's insane that I've managed to make the time for blogging (and working out again)!

						<br><br>

						When I think about things like these, it makes me a happy boy. I think that's the key to happiness in life: paying attention to the positive things in your life. I could write all day about my inner demons, but what good does it do? Yeah it's an outlet for them, but it doesn't really make me happy, it just makes me understand them. Thinking about the good things is what allows me to kill off those demons.

						<br><br>

						Alright well, this was a short one. No, it's not because I have no more happy things in my life! It's because I don't want to spoil every little thing that's going on. I just wanted to make a quick little wholesome post.

						<br><br>

						I don't know what else to say so I'm ending it here. Peace.
