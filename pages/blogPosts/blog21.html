						December 16, 2019

						<br><br>

						2019 was the best year of my life. How is that for a hook? To understand why 2019 was so great for me, first we need to understand the years that came before. For that, I will give you a brief history lesson.

						<br><br>

						So I started keeping track around late 2016, but at that point I had memories of the few years prior. The first year I have plotted on this chart is good ol' 2013. This is the year that I started high school. Freshman year wasn't that great. I was unconfident, unsure, and I didn't know who I was. This is the lowest point in the metaphorical graph. I fell in love with a girl, and subsequently realized that I had nothing going for me, so the girl would never even notice me. That's some pretty heavy hitting stuff for a 14 year old. I realized that I was worthless.

						<br><br>

						And mind me, saying I'm worthless sounds like a terrible way to think of myself, but it was true. I was pathetic. I never stood up for myself, I never improved myself, I didn't have much going for me. It was a good thing that I realized this because then I was able to do something about it. That's where 2014 comes in.

						<br><br>

						During 2014, I reached out on the internet to figure out how to make a girl fall in love with me. I was 15 at this point, so don't expect much. During 2014, I would reach and ingest these ideas that I found online. I had to get out of my head. I had to realize that I actually can make myself be worth something. This year was a slight uptick on the graph.

						<br><br>

						2015 was when I actually started to make progress. I started to actually put into practice the things I had read online. It was a mentality shift that I had learned. Before anyone else could love me, I had to first love myself. Before I could love myself, I needed to improve myself. I took these self improvement mindsets that I had learned and I practiced and refined them. 2015 had a gain upward.

						<br><br>

						2016 was when I first started seeing results. People started treating me differently. I started acting differently consistently. I would stand up for myself. I defined values in my life, and I knew where I wanted to be. There was a tick upward.

						<br><br>

						And then 2017 came. This was my last semester in high school, and that's when I realized that I knew who I was. I had worked hard, and I had achieved happiness. I wasn't outcome dependent like I was. I knew that I still had worth even though that girl in freshman year didn't like me. I knew that I had worth because I built it for myself. This was the journey that I came on, and now I was ready to embark into the journey of college. I had spent the past years building myself up for this moment. I was ready. 2017 was a large tick upward.

						<br><br>

						So I went to college, and it was nice, but when 2018 came, I was for the first time in a long time, unsure again. 2018 was a major tick down. Things hadn't gone the way I thought they were. I wasn't seeing the results I wanted to see. I started this blog for that very reason; I was sad, and I didn't know what to do anymore. Had all of my progress been for naught?

						<br><br>

						And 2019 came in and said NO! You are awesome because you've made that progress. Sure, life kicked your butt last year, and not everything went your way, but are you going to just sit Aaround and wallow in your misery? What would 2017 you think? What would 2013 you think? What do you think of yourself now?!

						<br><br>

						So I got back on the grind. Yeah things had went wrong, but I wasn't going to let them go wrong forever. It just isn't in the nature that I've created for myself. So, I got back to work.

						<br><br>

						And I succeeded again.

						<br><br>

						I became stronger than I've ever been in my life.

						<br><br>

						I got an internship that was better than I could have ever asked for.

						<br><br>

						I had two project classes where I got first place of 78 in one, and second of 84 in the other.

						<br><br>

						I became confident in my skills as a software engineer.

						<br><br>

						I started to expand upon my animations, and get outside my comfort zone so I could improve.

						<br><br>

						I freakin' coded an animation program from scratch.

						<br><br>

						I got a better understanding of my vision of myself after college.

						<br><br>

						I realized the love I shared with my friends and family.

						<br><br>

						I had the greatest year of my life.

						<br><br>

						Now of course, my year wasn't perfect. It's easy to say, "2019 was the greatest year of my life" and have people think things poorly about me, as if I'm trying to brag. I'm not trying to brag. When I say something like this, I don't outwardly say what didn't go well. That would be silly. Celebrate your successes, not your failures.

						<br><br>

						But yes, I still have a lot I need to improve. 2020 is a year where I expect a lot of changes to happen, both within my life, and within the world. It will be hard to surpass how great 2019 was, but if you're not improving your year by year happiness levels, then there's something you need to address. That's what I did in 2018, and it worked out for me.

						<br><br>

						So take this knowledge with you wherever you go. I don't know if you'll gain anything from it. It's my life, not yours. But whatever happens, I hope you have a great 2020.

						<br><br>

						Regards,
