					<h1>Fall 2019 - The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</h1>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						September 3, 2019

						<br><br>

						The fall semester of my junior year started last week, and it's that time again to give an overview of how this semester is looking.

						<br><br>

						Here are the classes I am taking this semester:

						<br><br>

						Engl 314 - Technical Writing<br>
						Com S 230 - Discrete Computational Structures (AKA Discrete Math)<br>
						Com S 309 - Software Development Practices<br>
						S E 319 - Constructing User Interfaces<br>

						<br><br>

						The class list is solid once again this semester. I am only taking four classes, and one of them is an online class. This gives me A LOT of free time. I'm looking forward to that. Let's get into the individual classes.

					</p>

					<strong><h1>Technical Writing</h1></strong>

					<h3>The Good</h3>

					<p class="p-blog-post">
						I've done technical writing before. I've had personal projects that I've done writeups on, and I've also done technical writing with instructions and documentation for when I worked tech support. I've done this before, and if I put in the time, this class shouldn't be difficult.
					</p>

					<br><br><h3>The Bad</h3>

					<p class="p-blog-post">
						There aren't really any negatives to this class if I'm being honest. The class should be fairly easy and straightforward, and it's an important skill to develop.
					</p>
					<br><br><h3>The Ugly</h3>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						It's an online course. That means it's entirely up to me to keep track of assignments and the like. I also won't really be able to meet anyone in the class.
					<br><br>
					</p>
					<strong><h1>Discrete Computational Structures</h1></strong>

					<h3>The Good</h3>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						Man good ol' discrete math. It will help me brush up on thinking logically, which is really important for software engineering, but man is it going to be a pain doing it.
					</p>
					<br><br><h3>The Bad</h3>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						This class is going to take a large chunk of my time. It may even be the hardest class I'm taking this semester.
					</p>
					<br><br><h3>The Ugly</h3>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						Proofs. I'm sure that word instills fear in some people reading this. I've never been good with proofs, and this class is going to have A LOT of them.
					<br><br>
					</p>
					<strong><h1>Software Development Practices</h1></strong>

					<h3>The Good</h3>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						This is going to be my favorite class. It's a project class in a group a 4 for the entire semester. You work on 1 single project and utilize different agile methods, and create a product. I have a really solid group, and I just came out of an internship where I did this exact thing. We're going to crush this class.
					</p>
					<br><br><h3>The Bad</h3>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						The only thing bad about this class is how they grade you. They grade you based on your experience, which is good, but it makes it hard to actually figure out what you need to get a good grade.
					</p>
					<br><br><h3>The Ugly</h3>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						I don't know if this is a positive or a negative, but our group is really driven. That probably means that this class will end up being a large amount of work, and that's where it gets a little messy.
					<br><br>
					</p>
					<strong><h1>Constructing User Interfaces</h1></strong>

					<h3>The Good</h3>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						This class goes over some very necessary things that I haven't really learned yet, like server side technology. It'll be nice to finally learn that, and for the most part, it should be applicable.
					</p>
					<br><br><h3>The Bad</h3>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						2 of the 3 sessions has had a TA teach them. I also can't really understand the TA at all, and he says the word "Um" between every other word. It's going to be a lot of outside learning with this class...
					</p>
					<br><br><h3>The Ugly</h3>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						I don't really know exactly what I'm going to be learning in this class. I know it covers some basic server stuff as I mentioned above, but from what I've heard from people who took the class previously, it's pretty disorganized.
