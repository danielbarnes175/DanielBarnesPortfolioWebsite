						December 9, 2018

						<br><br>

						I've decided that I'm not going to make a blog post everyday. Instead, I am going to keep the original purpose and write when I have something on my mind. So, here I am, with something on my mind...

						<br><br>

						I've increasingly noticed in recent years, that society is changing. I'm not sure how much of what I noticed is from me just growing up and paying more attention, or from society actually changing.

						<br><br>

						Society is changing, and man, I don't like where it's going. It seems that we are getting ever so increasingly close to some kind of apocalyptic or dystopian state. Maybe in 100 years someone will find this post and think something along the lines of, "So they were aware of what was happening..."

						<br><br>

						I have a few topics on my mind for this one. I have a few points within society that I'm just not content with. It might come off as me complaining, but in reality, I'm not complaining, I'm just acknowledging that this is the way it is. Life goes on.

						<br><br>

						My first one is the enourmous societal pressure to succeed. We live in a time where there gap between the lower class and upper class is increasingly rapidly. It seems that either you're rich, or you're poor. 
						Nobody wants to be poor. Nobody wants to be poor, so we look for ways to break out. There's that pressure to do well in school, so you aren't poor. There's the pressure to devote all of your energy to your job. There's this pressure that there's always something more that you should be doing.

						<br><br>

						There's this pressure to improve yourself because if you don't, you'll be cast out of society. I see it already. People cast out the ones that don't provide value. I don't necessarily think that it is something new, however, society has always deemed those that provide value as a higher worth. The problem I see is when suicide rates are rising. Somehow our lifetime expectancy is going down. I think that this pressure to succeed has increased.

						<br><br>

						No longer is society just in its little bubble. No longer do you grow up and never see the outside world. We're in the Age of Information. As individuals, we have the entire world within our grasp. At least that's what it seems like society wants us to think. We can do whatever we want if we just put our minds to it, so when we fail, obviously it just was because we didn't try hard enough. That's the pressure that society is placing on us to succeed.

						<br><br>

						I don't think that I would be able to get through this one without talking about politics. Society is more polarized than we have ever been. There are two sides. Us versus them. The good side and the absolutely horrible side that doesn't deserve to live.

						<br><br>

						Nobody is even willing to consider other's opinions. One of my favorite books is <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> by Harper Lee. I don't know the exact quote, but in the book the main character's father says something along the lines of, 'Before you judge somebody, try to walk a day in their shoes. Try to see the world from their perspective,' and this quote just resonates with me. No longer do people try to acknowledge other people's experiences. No longer do people try to even consider that the other side would work better for the other person. If it doesn't work well with me, then I'm against it.

						<br><br>

						Everyone is just so focused on themselves. I sit in the bus at school and I look around me. Everyone is just looking at their phones. People have headphones in. People block themselves off from the world. Could it be that people don't want to talk to others because they don't want to risk something going wrong? They don't want to take the risk that someone else will bring them an unpleasant conversation, despite the odds that the opposite is more likely to happen.

						<br><br>

						Why are our attention spans shortening? Why is it so difficult for me to sit down and study for a few hours. Has the algorithm for social media where it's constantly presenting new posts to keep my brain guessing gotten so good where it has changed my brain to not be able to focus without me even realizing it? What kind of brainwashing is society doing to us that we can't even realize because it has gotten so good.

						<br><br>

						Where am I supposed to find news these days that doesn't seem like it's pushing an agenda? Where am I supposed to find information when it seems like all of the information is leaving out something important. Why are algorithms built to show me the content that appeals to me. What if every now and then I want something to challenge my view? At least I can acknowledge that I'm stuck in an echo chamber. I'm recommended videos in youtube on topics that take the side I believe in. I never see the other side of the argument because society has shown that they do not like to listen to the other side. What about people that don't realize they are in an echo chamber? What about the children of today's world that are being raised like this. They are being taught not to question themselves. They are being taught that it's ok to slander your opponent as long as it shuts him or her down.

						<br><br>

						What is going on with society?

						<br><br>

						Why is there an attack on men disguised as freedom for women? If you even suggest that men have problems, you are laughed at and put down. Some women these days talk about how they have to be vigilant at all times because at any moment they could be kidnapped or raped. Really? You're going to live in fear your entire life because you've eaten the food that the media has fed you. I truly believe that the majority of people are good people. What do these people believe that has caused them to think this?

						<br><br>

						Why are you harshly criticized if you suggest that there are differences between men and women? Just having differences doesn't make one better than the other. It just is a fact that makes them different. I hesitate even writing this part in the blog because even though nobody reads this, what if somehow someone does and attacks me because of my views. My name is on this website, so what if I'm doxxed because of this. It's why I hesitate about putting too many of my less socially acceptable ideas on this blog. I don't want to put something out there that will lead to me getting doxxed. I don't want to ruin my life just because I share my ideas.

						<br><br>

						Attacking those who don't believe in your opinion is quite possibly the worst way to convince them to change their ways, yet people in society still do it. People protest and shut down rallies or talks that they don't agree with rather than try to empathize with them and ask why they think the way they do. When you shut them down, it makes them feel like they are losing their right to speak and just makes them burrow deeper into their ideology.

						<br><br>

						What else is wrong with society? There's definitely a whole lot, but these are some of the main things that I've been having most of my gripes with.

						<br><br>

						Don't get me wrong, I still think society is a great thing. I think that people that call for revolutions (in the US at least) and anarchy are idiots. Society is able to accomplish things that we could never dream of accomplishing individually. I'm looking forward to the things that are coming in the future. Self driving cars will be a great achievement for society. Don't even get me started on all the things that are coming from space. There's a whole universe of wonder and mystery out there, and we're the first people who will be able to experience it at a deeper level. Just the other day, I was listening to a video of wind on Mars. That's wild.

						<br><br>

						Society is a good thing, but man, it definitely has some problems.
