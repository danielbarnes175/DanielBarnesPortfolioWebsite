						November 29, 2018

						<br><br>

						One thing that I've always considered myself is creative. I've always been able to figure out some brand new way to do something, or come up with a fun little idea for something. It's always been one of the things that I pride myself in the most.

						<br><br>

						One thing that is making me reconsider that is this very blog. It's only day 6 and I'm already running out of ideas that I want to write about. For so long I've been developing ideas on certain things and I would always think to myself, "Man, I wish I could share these ideas with the world." And now I'm actually doing it.

						<br><br>

						Well, maybe the world isn't reading these posts, but hey, if the world wanted to, they could. Even if I'm just throwing words out there, it doesn't really matter to me if people are seeing it. It also helps that there are no metrics for success (at least that I have setup currently). I have no way to see how many people read each post. It could be 0, or it could be 10,000,000. It doesn't really matter all too much.

						<br><br>

						Back to me reconsidering my creative aspects. It was mostly a joke, but there is a little seriousness in it. When I would have these thoughts that I want to share with the world, it would probably be about one per week. The thing is I'm doing a daily blog. I'm doing a daily blog with ideas that only come up once a week. The math doesn't work out, and I'm already fresh out of ideas.

						<br><br>

						Despite that, I still wish to power on. I'm going to keep posting. I'm going to do my best to do this every single day. It's something I want to make into a habit. Some posts will be stronger than others because some I will have thought about a lot, while others I will be coming up with on the spot.

						<br><br>

						I was never too into reading blogs to be honest. I would read a post that piqued my interest every now and then, but I wouldn't consistently read a specific person's blog. This kind of makes me wonder if the topics that they wrote about on their blog were actually kind of small.

						<br><br>

						Like if they wrote a post about software development using Microsoft's cool new thing, are all their posts about software development? Do most bloggers have a niche that they fit into?

						<br><br>

						This also makes me wonder if people do daily blogs. Do they just talk about what's going on in their day to day lives? I could do that, and I probably will every now and then, but not constantly. My life is way too boring for that. Most people's lives are.

						<br><br>

						I want to write about things that hold substance. I want to write about things that actually matter to me. I want to write about the thoughts floating around inside my head. The thing is I've never done anything like this before. Will these thoughts run dry eventually?

						<br><br>

						I can also replenish the thoughts by reading a good book, or listening to a podcast, or even reading an article/blog post type writing made by someone else. The thing is I don't always have time to do this. I'm in college right now, and college is a lot of work.

						<br><br>

						I've already committed on doing this blog thing, and I've already noticed that it takes a solid chunk of my time. Could there be a way to reduce this while still keeping the same quality? Maybe these are the things that I'll notice as I write more.

						<br><br>

						I've always liked writing. When I was younger for a brief time I wanted to be an author, and then another time I wanted to be an English teacher. I'm glad I didn't choose either of these fields, but to some extent I still think that they would have made me feel fulfilled. Maybe someday I'll write a book and publish it. Maybe I'll make a compilation of my top 100 blog posts. Maybe I'll do something else, but this blog is going to be an outlet for me to improve my writing and also to do something I enjoy.

						<br><br>

						Unfortunately, this keeps bringing us back to the main problem: ideas. I have to be thinking throughout the day, "What do I want to write about tonight." Sometimes, however, I'm just too swamped with other problems I have to think about and when the time comes to write the blog I'm at a standstill. I just start writing with no thought going into it. 

						<br><br>

						I still think it turns out alright, but I don't want to keep doing that. Like I said before, I want substance. Maybe the solution is to take a day out of every month and just brainstorm blog post ideas. Then when I go to write the blog if I don't have a good idea I can just grab one from the list.

						<br><br>

						It's an extra step in the process, and it forces me to ask myself, "How much do I truly want to invest in this?" Is it worth it to put so much thought into something that nobody will ever see? What if I used all this time to work on a project or apply to jobs? I don't really know if that's a question I can answer now. Hindsight is 2020, and unfortunately I don't have very much of that in relation to this blog. Not yet. Maybe a year from now I'll have that first year's worth of posts and think, "Man I am glad I did that," or maybe I'll look back and think, "I could have discovered the cure to cancer if I just didn't do that stinkin' blog."

						<br><br>

						I think I'm getting a bit off topic on this one. Or maybe I'm just adding a little narrative padding in order to make the post longer. There's only so much you can say when all you need to say is, "Oh wow, I am running out of ideas a lot faster than I thought I would..."

						<br><br>

						This problem might just be part of the fun of doing this thing though. Who knows.
