					<h1>Controlling the Actions of Others</h1>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						November 30, 2018

						<br><br>

						Originally today I was going to write about failure, but some things happened a few hours before I started writing that I think make up a good topic. I won't go into depth, but basically somebody I know did something to me that upset me.

						<br><br>

						It was the action of another that set my mood. Leading up to the event, I was having a pretty solid day, but this person whether intentionally or not just set me off in a bad way.

						<br><br>

						This blog post is about controlling the actions of others, though, and I intend for the majority of it to be about that. I think starting off on the actions that we want to control is a really good way to do that.

						<br><br>

						What if I just could have controlled this person to not do what they did. What if I could just micromanage those around me to do what I want. What if I could manipulate people into doing things my way.

						<br><br>

						Sound manipulative?

						<br><br>

						I always struggle with explaining this concept. Control, I feel, has such a negative connotation to it. There are times when control has positive meanings, but in general, it is associated with bad things such as not having control, or maybe even controlling the masses.

						<br><br>

						I don't want my manipulation to be taken negatively. Imagine you are trying to buy a car. You negotiate the price of the car in order to get a better deal. The words you say and the things you do in this situation are inherently manipulative. You're trying to manipulative the salesman to give you a better deal. Do people think that manipulating like this is bad?

						<br><br>

						Of course, there are many lines that you can draw in when this kind of manipulation is ok. Who are you manipulating? Who gains from the manipulation? Why are you manipulating? There's many lines, but for simplicities sake, lets just say I control every person's interactions.

						<br><br>

						Somehow I have this innate charisma that I can use to convince anyone to do anything for me. I would be a king! No, I would be a god! Would it be a bad thing?

						<br><br>

						What if I manipulated people to end wars. What if I manipulated companies to be truthful about their practices. What if I manipulated in a way where everyone benefits? Or what if I manipulated to become the richest person in the world? Or what if I manipulated to have everyone be a slave to me?

						<br><br>

						The point I'm trying to make is that I could be either good or bad. There are definitely ways to manipulate people that are real, and I want to know how to do it because these skills can be useful. Additionally, knowing these skills would help for me to recognize if these skills are being used against me.

						<br><br>

						Of course, in a realistic situation, you aren't going to be able to completely change the will for every action of every person you meet. In fact, I think the majority of people you won't be able to change all that much, at least not noticeably. That may just be my personal experience though, and I am curious how far someone can go in this manipulation rabbit hole, but I digress.

						<br><br>

						I don't think that you can change the majority of actions. So I guess we're out of luck on this whole thing aren't we? I think that we are mostly out of luck on changing other's actions. People are just going to continue being awful people.

						<br><br>

						So what do we do?

						<br><br>

						I guess we do the only thing that we can do: change our responses toward these actions. What if when that person did that thing to me earlier I didn't choose to get upset? What if I just acknowledged that it was a mistake that he made? I definitely could have.

						<br><br>

						You can change your reaction to what people do to you.

						<br><br>

						People usually respond to this thinking that it's impossible. Words hurt, right? Well, no, they don't really have to. You're letting the words affect you. You could choose just to ignore them.

						<br><br>

						It's not always going to be easy, and there will be times where you falter, like I did with the example I started this blog post with. It's a learning experience just like most things in life. You have to learn how to react positively to things that happen to you. You have to learn how to immediately disqualify any negative thoughts that pop up.

						<br><br>

						The thing is, it has to be a concious effort. You have to constantly make an effort throughout the day on being optimistic. With today's world, there are countless numbers of things that are trying to pull us down. It's up to you to not let them.
