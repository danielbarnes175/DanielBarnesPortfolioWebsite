					<h1>Ramblings of a Madman</h1>

						<br><br>

						It's a funny thing, y'know. This blog. What? You don't think it's funny? Well, that's ok, humor is subjective. Although wait a second, if you don't think this blog is funny, then why are you here? For entertainment? I'm sure that there are better places you can find that. For something else? What is it? You don't know why you're here? That's a shame. I think you should always know why you're somewhere, even if that somewhere is a place you don't want to be.

						<br><br>

						Why am I here? I'll be honest with you; I don't know. I know, I did just say that you should always know why you're somewhere. I break my very own rule. It isn't the first time that this has happened, nor is it the last. So why do I have the rule?

						<br><br>

						It makes me think. It makes me wonder how I got to the point I am at. Is it my own effort? Is it the generosity of others? Is it by some dumb luck that things just managed to work out this way? Was I born into this life? Is this my fate? Is it any of these things, or are these just the ramblings of a madman?

						<br><br>

						Sometimes I question my own sanity. Am I crazy? I don't think so. I think that I'm completely normal, but sometimes I look at the outside world and I see what everyone else achieves and then I look to myself and I don't feel so normal anymore. I look on social media and see the highlights of everyone's lives and I know that they're highlights, but I can't help but compare my life to theirs.

						<br><br>

						Sometimes I see these things and I feel lonely. Sometimes I see these things and I get excited. I get happy when people I've known in the past succeed at something. Everyone has things that they're aiming to achieve. Yet, sometimes I see these things and I don't feel so normal.

						<br><br>

						Why aren't these things happening in my life? Is this jealousy, or is it something else? Do I yearn to be like these people? If I had what they had would I be able to be normal?

						<br><br>

						Or maybe it's these thoughts that make me normal. I think deep down everyone has these thoughts. Maybe it's the technology that we're glued to these days. Maybe we have grown disconnected as a species. Maybe I'm just a madman.

						<br><br>

						Am I unhappy? Am I ok? Why are you asking these questions? Were those last few paragraphs a little too real? If you felt that they were too real, then that's a good thing because they are real.

						<br><br>

						My words being real isn't necessarily something bad. It isn't something to be feared. In fact, I think acknowledging that these thoughts are real is the best thing that can be done. That's a rule that I won't break. I won't lay my inner madman to rest. He's the one that let's me understand the complexities of life. He's on our side. Trust me.

						<br><br>

						I suppose that I should answer your questions now. You really want to hear the answer don't you? I'll ease your curiosity for now. 'Am I unhappy?' No. I am not unhappy. I honestly enjoy life, and I take pleasure in the simple things. 'Am I ok?' Yes. You have no need to worry. I'm just letting these thoughts surface, that's why something might seem amiss. Trust me, though, these thoughts aren't thoughts that I'm afraid of.

						<br><br>

						When I was in middle school, think 7th and 8th grade, I felt lonely. It was the first time in my life that I was able to notice my loneliness. Back then, I didn't understand how to fight it. I didn't know what to do. Why wasn't I popular? Why wasn't I apart of the so called 'cool' kids? Back then these thoughts scared me.

						<br><br>

						The story for overcoming that is quite a long one, and it made me who I am today, but I will have to save it for far into the future. When I have these thoughts now though, when I feel disconnected, I am able to cope with them.

						<br><br>

						Maybe you have these feelings of insecurity. Maybe you have feelings of loneliness. Feelings where you don't think that you're good enough. Feelings that make you think that it won't be ok. 

						<br><br>

						These feelings are normal. Trust me when I say that everyone goes through them. Do you think that you're special? You're special because you have these thoughts? I had these thoughts, does that make me special? No. It makes us human.

						<br><br>

						I can't tell you how to overcome these thoughts. Everyone has to overcome their own mind in different ways. It makes you grow as a person. When has success ever come without failure?

						<br><br>

						Everyone has their own path. I choose to write about my path. It helps because when I turn it into a story, I'm really writing an outline for my brain to understand it all. Sometimes these feelings of not knowing why you're here are just a string of thoughts in your mind that have no way of sorting themselves. You have to figure out how to sort them.

						<br><br>

						More questions? I don't know how much more that I can answer. Wasn't this about me? I guess I can answer that. Maybe it was initially about me, or maybe it was about a completely random person. It could have been a person with no name. It could have been a person with no story. Maybe it was about you?

						<br><br>

						Or maybe it was just the ramblings of a madman.
