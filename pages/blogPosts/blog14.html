						<br><br>

						Hey.

						<br><br>

						It's been a while, hasn't it? Where were we the last time I updated this thing? December 9th. It was the Sunday before finals week. It's been over a month. This is officially the longest break for this blog that I've had. So much for updating this every day...

						<br><br>

						I don't remember if I said it in another blog post or not, but I won't be updating this everyday anymore. I will only be writing in it when I need somewhere to write down my thoughts. I'll write in it when I need an outlet.

						<br><br>

						So what's going on in my life now? Why did I choose today to start writing again? What kind of outlet will this be today? Well, to be frank, I don't really need to write this today, however, I'm at a turning point in my life, and I figured it would be a good idea to write something.

						<br><br>

						Turning point? What do you mean?

						<br><br>

						Well today is the last day where I'll be on winter break. I'm going back to school tomorrow, Saturday the 12th. Technically school doesn't start until Monday, but now I will have to get back in the school mindset. I have to fix my sleep schedule. I have to start making my own food. I have to actually have organization in my life.

						<br><br>

						On one hand, I'm looking forward to it. On the other hand, I'm scared out of my mind. I'm scared because the effects of last semester are still lingering. I was not in a very good place last semester. I was trudging through, and finally my finals ended and it was over. Winter break could not have come any sooner. It came at just the right time, and now I'm in an OK spot mentally. I made it through the semester. I'm worried, however, that the pains that hurt me in the first semester will come back.

						<br><br>

						I hadn't really done anything to get rid of them last semester. I tried, but I was too far gone by the time I tried to take back control. The reason that they went away is because the semester ended. There was no more cause for stress.

						<br><br>

						I'm scared that the underlying causes are still there. I hadn't really ever figured out what they were. 

						<br><br>

						Last semester I received the first ever D grade in a class in my entire life. It was a struggle. I need to figure out a way to prevent that from happening again. There is a paradox here though. By trying to reduce the stress in my life, I am putting stress on myself to do that. This is the crossroads that I have arrived at.

						<br><br>

						So I can't choose any road. I have to go blind off the path and hope that the way I am going is correct. Isn't that just something that everyone goes through, though? Aren't we all just following a path that doesn't actually exist? We don't know where it will go. We don't know if it will ever end. It is just a path that is created as we trek forward.

						<br><br>

						I think that this semester will be different. I think that this semester will be better. I'm scared, but I won't let it hinder me. I'm looking forward to the future with bright eyes. I'm looking forward to the future with hope.

						<br><br>

						I have long been away from that stage in my life where I was at the peak. It's time to create an even higher peak. I mean hey, it is the New Year, and you know what they say:

						<br><br>

						New Year, New Me.
