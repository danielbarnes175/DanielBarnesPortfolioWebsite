					<h1>Spring 2019 - The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</h1>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						January 21, 2019

						<br><br>

						The first week of classes is over, so I figure I would take the time to do a writeup on what I expect from this semester. Before the semester started, I was uneasy about what to expect, but after going through a week, I'm not worried anymore.

						<br><br>

						I guess I'll start with a list of the classes that I am taking.

						<br><br>

						Math 267 - Differential Equations<br>
						Com S 327 - Advanced Programming<br>
						Com S 321 - Introduction to Machine Architecture and Machine Level Programming<br>
						Com S 363 - Introduction to Databases<br>
						Sp Cm 212 - Fundamentals of Public Speaking<br>

						<br><br>

						These are the classes that I'm taking, and I think it is a solid lineup. I don't think the classload will be too difficult, and I think that I will be learning very important concepts in each class. Anyway, onto the breakdown.

						<br><br>
						</p>
							<strong><h1>Differential Equations</h1></strong>
											
						<h3>The Good</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						From what I've heard, this class is the easiest of the classes that use Calculus. I also have 3 people I know in my class and recitation, so that's a big bonus. According to what people have said, I also have a very good professor, but judgement will come at a later time for that.

						</p>
						<br><br><h3>The Bad</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						My professor has an accent. It isn't completely thick that I can't understand what he says, but I struggle with a word every now and then. His handwriting is awful VERY bad, making taking notes and learning in class a challenge. Luckily, there are outside resources that I will use.

						</p>
						<br><br><h3>The Ugly</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						It's a math class. I am going to have to put in a lot of work if I want to succeed, and math not being a topic I'm particularly interested in, this might end up as a struggle.

						<br><br>
						</p>
							<strong><h1>Advanced Programming</h1></strong>

						
						<h3>The Good</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						This is a class where the first half of the semester is in C, while the second half of the semester is C++. Having little experience in both of those, I am looking forward to extending my skillset and knowledge. We even use Linux VMs, so I'm learning how to use Linux as well. The professor also seems very supportive, and knowledgable. Judging by his responses to posts people have made on the class forum (piazza) he wants to see us grow.

						</p>
						<br><br><h3>The Bad</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						This class will probably be my largest workload of the semester. My professor said that we should expect assignments that take an average of 10 hours per week, so I am very much not looking forward to that.

						</p>
						<br><br><h3>The Ugly</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						I did say that I was looking forward to learning about C and C++, but at the same time, it's going to be ugly. My knowledge of C is limited to basically concepts that are in every language such as loops, or conditionals. I'm unsure about memory management, something very prevelant in C, but not in Java, the language I am most comfortable with. Onto C++ I have absolutely 0 experience (depending on if you consider knowing some C applicable to C++), so that will be fun.

						<br><br>
						</p>
							<strong><h1>Introduction to Machine Architecture and Machine Level Programming</h1></strong>

						
						
						<h3>The Good</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						From what it seems, this class will be practical applications of Big Oh notation. It is actually analyzing efficiency and runtime speeds and cost in order to make the best possible software. It makes me think of it as an Econ class disguised as a coding class, and that's a good thing. I liked AP Economics in high school.

						</p>
						<br><br><h3>The Bad</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						Besides the economics vibe I get from it, I really have no idea what this class entails. I'm assuming there's going to be a lot of assembly programming, which isn't all that amazing. I'm also unsure about how homework assignments will be, and I'm unable to tell how difficult the class is going to be. I think this class needs a couple more week for judgement.

						</p>
						<br><br><h3>The Ugly</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						I don't know anybody in the class, and the atmosphere isn't conducive to making friends. Nobody I know is even taking the class with a different professor, so when the time comes and I need help with something, I won't have many places to go, unfortunately.

						<br><br>
						</p>
							<strong><h1>Introduction to Databases</h1></strong>

						
						
						<h3>The Good</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						It's a class about databases! Databases are probably one of the most important concepts in programming in the real world. Last semester I took a course on data structures, and now I'm going to a higher level on a larger scale with DATABASES! I'm very excited to learn with this class.
	
						</p>
						<br><br><h3>The Bad</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						The class might not be all its hyped up to be. The professor on the first day of class stated, "My view of databases is different than what is prevelant." It's very possible that I will be learning concepts in this class that are out of date, and not even relevant to the current programming world.

						</p>
						<br><br><h3>The Ugly</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						I was so worried in fact, that I asked the professor if what we would be learning if it is practical. He replied with, "See, I have a hard time answering that," and then said some things that dodged the question. The fact that he can't straight up say that it will be useful is worrying. I have the opinion that universities should be teaching us what will make us successful in the workforce, and I don't know if this class will be doing that. It looks like the professor is just stubborn and refuses to conform to what is actually focused on in modern society. 

						<br><br>
						</p>
							<strong><h1>Fundamentals of Public Speaking</h1></strong>
						<p class="p-blog-post">
						
						</p>
						<h3>The Good</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						This is the class that I am most excited for. It's a small class size (about 20 people) so it gives me the opportunity to actually meet people and develop a connection. I didn't know anybody coming into the class, which some might see as a bad thing, but I think for a class like this it is a good thing. It will allow me to push out of my comfort zone and achieve greater things.<br><br>

						</p>
						<h3>The Bad</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						Things that are bad about this class? I honestly can't really think of any. Maybe the fact that it is only 2 days a week, so any friends I want to make in the class I won't see them as much. Yet, for a class that I want to be a low priority, the benefits of having it only twice a week outweight the negatives.<br><br>

						</p>
						<h3>The Ugly</h3>
						<p class="p-blog-post">

						I think that I already know about how to publically speak. In fact, I enjoy it at times. I think this class will be mostly a rehash of what I already know, and will end up just taking up time that I could better spend on other things that maybe I don't already know. I have a feeling eventually the class will become a bore to me and I might start to slack on classwork. I have to be sure to keep up my work on this class because then I believe that it will be a nice GPA booster.
