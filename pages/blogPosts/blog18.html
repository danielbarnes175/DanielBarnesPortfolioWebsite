						September 3, 2019

						<br><br>

						I know, I know. It's been a while hasn't it? It feels like it's been forever for me. So much stuff has happened. I got an internship over the summer. That was amazing. I feel like I'm at another high point in my life. 2018 wasn't the hottest year for me, and now that we're 9 months into 2019, I can say that it is the opposite for this year.

						<br><br>

						2019 is looking to be the greatest year of my life. I had an upward trend from 2015-2017, which sunk a little in 2018. 2019 though, hoo boy, it's been great. We're back on that uptick. We're back baby. Things are looking strong for us.

						<br><br>

						And that's why I haven't written in the blog for so long. When I don't have any conflicting thoughts going on in my mind that I need to sort out through writing, then what do I write about? I haven't really needed to write in the blog, but I feel like I'm doing a small disservice to historians in the future studying my legacy if I don't update this bad boy.

						<br><br>

						So man, what do I talk about? Politics? Yuck. Society? A little better, but not really that important for me right now. Technology and software engineering? That's an idea I like. I'll have some blog posts relating to that, but I don't want this blog to become too nerdy. I want something that humanizes me a little, so I'm going to have to get a little creative with my ideas. I gotta spice up this blog, or else what will the people writing my biography talk about?

						<br><br>

						I hope you're ready to add some spice.
