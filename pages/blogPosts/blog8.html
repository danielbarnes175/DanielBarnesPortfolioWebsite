						December 2, 2018

						<br><br>

						What am I doing?!? I didn't make a blog post yesterday! I was awake from 6am-2am the next day, how did I not find time to make a blog post? I had just completed a week, and now I've gone ahead and broken my streak! It's fine, though, it's recoverable. I'm going to give you a good ol' two part blog post today that also act as standalone posts. This is going to be good.

						<br><br>

						What do I want in life? What do I NEED in life? What is my mission? For far too long I have been going through life without a mission. For FAR TOO LONG I have been aimlessly going with the flow. It's been over a year since I've gotten to college and yet I am still not satisfied.

						<br><br>

						What am I doing with my life?

						<br><br>

						From what it looks like to me, I'm just WASTING away myself. Sure I've been pushing and grinding for an internship. I've been learning code and I've been taking steps to improve things that I do.

						<br><br>

						But I have been slacking. I have been ignoring CRUCIAL steps in my self improvement journey. You know what? I don't even think I can call it a self improvement journey anymore because I just went up and stopped improving myself.

						<br><br>

						NO LONGER! I'm sick and tired of not having a goal. I'm sick and tired of trying to commit to something and then stopping a week later.

						<br><br>

						About 4 years back, I died. I killed off my previous self that played the victim card. I killed off my previous self that was stuck thinking that the opinions of others mattered. 2 years after that, I was on another plane of existence. I KNEW what I wanted. I KNEW how I was going to get it. I had a plan.

						<br><br>

						And then college finally came and things didn't go to plan. Upset after upset came and passed, and it took a toll on me. I started slipping. I started losing focus. I started turning into the person that I had viciously put into the ground.

						<br><br>

						I HAD NO MISSION!

						<br><br>

						So it is time. It is time to reclaim the mission that I once sought after. This time I want to remake my plan. I want to be able to stick to my plan, even when classes or work gets rough. I want to be able to stick to the plan when I run out of time, or be able to make the time when I get a lot of work.

						<br><br>

						So what's the plan? What's my mission? Here it is:

						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>1.</strong> I need to expand my social circle. I'm in college for crying out loud! Now is the time to make friends! Sure I've made a lot of friends at college, but how many do I consistently talk to? How many can I actually say are VERY good friends? How many friends have I made that I have fallen out of touch with? I need to expand my social circle because it is everchanging. I can't ever STOP making new friends. That's just the person that I want to be. I want to walk around campus and recognize people and have them recognize me. This happens every now and then, but I want more.<br><br>

								Maybe this one is just a silly little desire for external validation, but I don't see it that way. This goal allows me to improve my social skills, and being surrounded by people who actually like you DOES make you a happier person.
							</li>
							<br><br>
							<li>
								<strong>2.</strong> I need to start DOING things. Why am I frequently doing the same old activities every weekend? Why am I BORED when I spend my time doing something?! It is because I am not doing NEW things! I have grown stagnant and like all gross, stagnant bodies of water, nobody wants to spend time doing things.
								<br><br>
								If I myself am not excited by the things that I do, then how can I ever expect others to be? This coincides with my first point. How can I expect to make friends if I'm not going out and actually doing things? I need to be doing things that others like to do. I can't just sit home and play video games and waste my life away.
								<br><br>
								I need to stimulate the pond. I need to try something new. <strong>I need to face challenge and adversity.</strong> Those will never come if I don't DO SOMETHING.
								<br><br>
								I need to stop procrastinating. I need to stop putting things off. Do they need to get done? THEN DO THEM! It adds such an unnecessary stress to my life when I simply don't go out and do what I need to do.
							</li>
							<br><br>
							<li>
								<strong>3.</strong> Y'know, I've always thought of myself as a leader. Consistently through my life I've found myself in positions where I need to take charge. I ran a competitive Team Fortress 2 team, and that was the first situation where I truly led. I needed to organize the group and learn everyone's strengths and weaknesses. I needed to communicate with others and be able to respond when the time comes. I needed to make decisions on the fly, and be able to execute swiftly.
								<br><br>
								That was 5 years ago. So why am I so reluctant to lead now?
								<br><br>
								<strong>I NEED TO LEAD!</strong>
								<br><br>
								I am so hesistant to take charge now. I only take charge when someone puts me into that position. Why do I wait? What kind of leader doesn't put him or herself in charge? When a situation comes up, I need to put myself out there and instinctually take charge. I need to be sure of what to do. When a decision in a group comes up, I need to make it.
								<br>
								For too long a question on what we should do comes up, and I just ignore the problem. I wait until someone else takes charge. Why do I do that? If I consider myself a leader, why do I hesistate to lead? What kind of soldiers would follow someone who doesn't actually make the effort to lead? I need to be a leader.
							</li>
							<br><br>
							<li>
								<strong>4.</strong> I need to manage my time effectively. For some reason I always waste my time away on social media or my phone, and then I complain about not having enough time. I'm the one putting myself into this gosh darn position and then I have the <italic>AUDACITY</italic> to complain?! Come on Daniel! You're better than this.
								<br>
								I need to actually plan my time out. I need to WRITE DOWN what I need to get done. I need to actually DO what I say I will. I need to refocus on what I spend my time doing, and then identify and eliminate things that aren't contributing to my life. I need to replace them with things that add value. Do I spend an hour playing video games, or do I go WORK OUT? I think there's an obvious answer here.
							</li>
							<br><br>

						</ul>

					This is my mission.
