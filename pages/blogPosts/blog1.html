					<h1>My First Blog Post - On making the blog.</h1>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						November 24, 2018.

						<br><br>
						
						Well well well, looks like I finally got around to making a blog. Well, kind of. It isn't really a blog in the sense that you might think of me going onto a website, and filling in a post writing something, much like many blog hosting services around the world. Instead for some reason, I wanted to make my life difficult and my GitHub pages allowed size fill up quite fast.

						<br><br>

						As I'm writing this I have World On Fire from Tokyo ESP playing in my right ear, and I'm sitting on a cramped bus on my way back to college from Thanksgiving break. My bus ride is from 8:15am-5:00pm, so I decided to make the best of it and create a blog.

						<br><br>

						Now you might be thinking something along the lines of "How is your blog made? You said it wasn't what I would think of earlier..." Well Jimmy, calm down, I'll get to that. Instead I think I'll tell a story about a podcast I listened to last night, so strap in James, it is going to be a ride.

						<br><br>

						I knew that I had to get up early in order to be ready for my bus. Throughout Thanksgiving break, I had been waking up at 10 or 11. I need to fix that, I know, but that isn't the point. For the bus ride I would need to wake up at 5:45 am. It was early, but y'know maybe this would be the switch that I would need to start waking up early like all the Navy Seals say you should do.

						<br><br>

						Like any normal person that has to get up early, I went to bed at a completely reasonable time. Well, at least that's what I wanted to think. It was 10pm. I was laying in bed, thinking about how I should have gone to bed an hour earlier. Oh well, the opportunity had passed. Such a shame. I finally decided to try to fall asleep, but since it was Thanksgiving break, my entire family was home.

						<br><br>

						If you've never actually met the Barnes family in person, you would probably not know that they can get very loud. Well this time was no different, and a few of my sisters were talking, and laughing, and well, I couldn't really sleep well. This brings us to the part of the story that I brought you here for: I turned on a podcast.

						<br><br>

						I decided to listen to a podcast as I would fall asleep. The podcast was by Justin Stenstrom, and the guest was Neil Pasricha. Neil had written this book titled <u>The Happiness Equation</u> and he was here to talk about the happiness equation, and how to stay resilient when life pushes you down.

						<br><br>

						Long story short, part of the happiness equation was finding an outlet for your thoughts. The two main outlets that Neil pushed for were reading and writing. I like reading, but I thought that writing seemed a lot more my style. I love thinking about what's going on in my life, and being able to write it down will allow me to organize my thoughts. That's something that I think is very important, and a strong argument for needing an outlet that Neil brought forth.

						<br><br>

						So that's where this blog comes into play. I'll try to write as much as I can, but I also want to keep it in moderation because I do have other priorities such as school. And since we're talking about the blog again, I can finally let you know how the blog was created.

						<br><br>

						Much like this website and its use of static pages, the blog is no different in being horrible for code reuse. Each post is a seperate file in the folder for this website on my computer. In fact, to post to the blog, I have to make a commit on Git. I'm ok with this way of doing it though. It feels mmore like my creation this way. It fits more in line with my nerd-programming self. And hey, I also get some free Git contributions on my GitHub profile just for writing. Easy way to pad my stats, don't tell the recruiters!

						<br><br>

						I initially just wanted to make this post a short test to make sure the functionality was what I wanted, but I think that this actually turned into a solid first post. Crazy how when I start writing, it always ends up being more than what I bargained for. With that said, I'm going to end it here. If you enjoyed this, check out some of my other posts.

						<br><br>

						Cheers,
						<br>
