					<h1>Coding Grind</h1>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						February 9, 2019

						<br><br>

						So yesterday I spent a few hours grinding out a homework assignment I had. The assignment was for my class where we're making a dungeon crawler in C. For this specific one, we had to take our dungeon and save it to disc, and also implement a way to load in files.

						<br><br>

						I'll admit that I'm not the best with C. I'm not used to actually handling memory myself, so as you can guess, I ran into some problems. I ran into an issue where I was allocating memory for an array of a certain struct, and then storing data into that struct. The problem came when I wanted to use the array, in which I found out that the first 2 values in the array where complete garbage. For some reason the values I was setting were not saving correctly in the array.

						<br><br>

						I checked everything. I had to go printing the values and check them every time I even used the variable and I had to narrow down where the problem was occuring. About and hour and a half of troubleshooting later, I found the bug.

						<br><br>

						Turns out that I was calling free() on the array, which deallocated the memory, even though I would still need to use it. I moved the free() to later in the program, and it worked. As to why it only put garbage data for the first two structs in the array, and not the remaining four, I don't know.

						<br><br>

						I had spent an hour decoding this issue, and while yes, it was frustrating, I didn't want to stop. I kept going. It was a grind, but for some reason it didn't feel like it.

						<br><br>

						That's the magic with me and coding. I've found myself an activity where it can be a grind, but it's actually enjoyable. I've found myself an activity that I get immersed into and enter into a state of flow.

						<br><br>

						I've been thinking, how lucky am I that I found myself something that I enjoy doing, and actually has a monetary value. I've found something in my life that I don't have to worry if I'm choosing the right path; I know I am.

						<br><br>

						Then I was thinking a little more. What could make coding so reliable for putting me into "the zone"? What was actually so great about it?

						<br><br>

						And I came to an answer. When I'm coding and run into a bug, I don't know what is causing it. This requires me to LEARN. This requires me to actually think. It isn't just like a math problem where I have to find where I've made a mistake, I have to find where I could have made a mistake, and then narrow down if I've actually done it correctly.

						<br><br>

						I'm not sure how much sense that made. To explain it in another way, I can't just notice my mistake by looking through my code. I have to understand. I have to think deeper. I have to concentrate. I have to use my brain in a way that it is hardly used in other areas of my life.

						<br><br>

						And then I find the answer. I find the answer and I feel accomplished. I've learned something new, and I've implemented it. The results are there. I've succeeded.

						<br><br>

						And the next time I do something similar, I won't make the same mistake. I improve. I can look back on code that I've written before and see differences in the way I've done it before compared to how I would do it now.

						<br><br>

						It's the learning curve. I'm doing difficult things, but I can see myself improving. I can see myself getting better, while at the same time, it never seems like I'm completely stuck. There's never too short of a gap, or too large of a gap in knowledge that I have to cross.

						<br><br>

						Maybe it's something to do with the way Iowa State teaches. Maybe it's something to do with the way I learn. Either way, I know that this so called grind is perfect for me.
