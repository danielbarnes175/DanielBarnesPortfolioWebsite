						<br><br>

						Before we begin, I would like to put out there that this is blog post 10. We hit double digits! Woohoo! Now we just have to keep on grinding until we hit triple digits. Maybe eventually we'll be able to hit quadruple digits... Now that sounds like something quite a ways away. Think of how much still will have changed by then. I'll be out of college. I guess that's really it. I wonder what else will happen by then... Alas, I need to get back on topic. I'm already sacrificing my sleep to write this blog post (It's 10:11pm right now, and I'm waking up tomorrow at 5:00am).

						<br><br>

						Music. Music has been a huge part of my life. I've played music, I've listened to music, I've written music, I've sung music. The thing is that I still don't know what exactly makes music so gosh darn good! I couldn't really tell you why I enjoy music! Could it be that it distracts me from things going on, and allows me to enter a flow state? Could it be that the melodies are akin to something that humans have evolved to have a response to when they hear them? Could it be societal conditioning?

						<br><br>

						What is my brain trying to tell me when I listen to good music? What about bad music? Why does some music have no effect on me, while others cause me to develop tears? Do I associate the music with events that happened when I first heard them, and thus they cause an emotional response?

						<br><br>

						That would make sense for games and other media, but what about random playlists I just find on youtube of songs. Why can I find a random genre that I don't really listen to all that often like LoFi and feel at peace when I listen to it?

						<br><br>

						It's amazing how people can write music in order to envoke these feelings. I've tried writing music, and I can't say I'm any good at this. It's definitely a skill that when harnessed can create something beautiful.

						<br><br>

						My favorite music is Ska. Many people don't even know what Ska is, so then I ask them if they know what Reggae is. A lot of people will say yes that they know what Reggae is, but they really don't.

						<br><br>

						For the uninformed, Ska is basically a faster paced, upbeat song complemented with various horns, electric guitar, and a drumset. I guess a more apt descriptor of my favorite genre is Ska Punk, or Punk Ska depending on how you like to call it. They are one and the same.

						<br><br>

						My favorite band is Streetlight Manifesto. There are debates on whether or not they are to be considered a Ska band, and I'm on the side that thinks that they should be. If you're looking for a good song to introduce you to them, search up The Three of Us by them.

						<br><br>

						They aren't the only band I listen to. I also listen to the following:

						<br><br>

						The Holophonics<br>
						Coheed and Cambria<br>
						Avenged Sevenfold<br>
						Dangerkids<br>
						Five Iron Frenzy<br>
						Linkin Park<br>
						The Jonas Brothers<br>
						Catch 22<br>
						Mike Shinoda<br>
						The Darkness<br>
						Neon Trees<br>
						Magic!<br>
						Scouting for Girls<br>
						Our Last Night<br>
						Panic! at the Disco<br>
						Weezer<br>
						Icon for Hire<br>
						Fall Out Boy<br>
						Foo Fighters<br>
						Paramore<br>
						Melbourne Ska Orchestra<br>
						One OK Rock<br>
						Outkast<br>
						Party Like Its...<br>
						Reel Big Fish<br>
						Straight No Chaser<br>
						The XX<br>
						<br>

						...and many more artists including various YouTubers, more bands, and instrumental soundtracks. That list only includes bands that I have more than one of their songs in my playlist. So that gives a pretty good image of what I like to listen to, or so I hope.

						<br><br>

						I know that whenever something is going on in my life, I can fallback on music and it will change my mood entirely. It's always been a positive impact on my life. Unless, y'know its bad music...

						<br><br>

						I spent 8 years in band playing music. I spent 5 years in choir. Music is a part of me. My YouTube channel has songs with me singing. I am music. I'm going to continue making music, and also listening to music just because it's just so good.

						<br><br>

						I'm kind of abruptly ending this blog post, but such is life. See ya later alligators
