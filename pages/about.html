					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>
						My name is Daniel. I am currently a Sophomore at Iowa State University studying Software Engineering. I have a passion for coding, and a desire to create new things. Since this is my portfolio, I guess I should start by naming some languages that I think I'm a little ok with.
						<br>
						<br>
						
						My favorite language is Java and I would say it is the one that I have the most experience with. Following closely, we have Javascript, which I've learned to love after seeing Node.js and all the different NPM packages there are. I'm hoping to get better with my web development skills with Javascript, CSS, and HTML, which is part of the reason I'm making this website! After those languages, we have C and Python. Currently I've only studied Python outside of school, and only taken 1 semester in C, but I'm planning on expanding my knowledge of those in order to buff out my skillset.
						<br>
						<br>

						Now that we have that nerd stuff out of the way, let's continue on to some things that I like to do in my free time. I love soccer; it is my favorite sport. I love to play percussion instruments, and play guitar. I love to sing songs and create music. I love to make animations (Although they are <em>very</em> time consuming!). I touched on it before, but I think I should mention again that I have a desire to create new things. This is evidenced by my <a href="html://www.youtube.com/c/bballdaniel3">Youtube</a> channel. I put a lot of the things I make for fun there, and personally I think it's pretty entertaining.
						<br>
						<br>

						Those are my main interests. I could go on about how I love the intricacies of the Star Wars universe (Well, the stuff they made non-canon) or nerd out about how much I love Git, but I think this is a solid base for learning about who I am. If you want to learn more, I would love if you contacted me, even if it's just to have a chat.
						<br>
						<br>

						Enjoy the site.
