					<h1>Failure</h1>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						December 6, 2018

						<br><br>

						For the longest time, I've thought of failure as something to embrace. I've thought of failure as something that allows you to push further than you had gone before. I've thought of failure as a necessary component to achieving success. What if all my preconceived notions were actually incorrect?

						<br><br>

						I still think that failure is the best way to grow. You can take a look at why you failed and improve upon it for the next time. I want to counter that with the idea that some failure is worthless.

						<br><br>

						I've been experiencing a lot of failure in my life. To name a few ones that have been in my mind recently: I'm at a high risk of failing my linear algebra class-- this would be the first time in my life that I've ever failed a class-- I have a project for a class that I have to demo today that's worth 7% of my grade-- it doesn't even work-- and even another one where I missed yet another day of making this blog. 13 days in and I've missed 2 days. That's not a really high success rate for a daily blog...

						<br><br>

						What is even the point of these failures? Is it a wake-up call to myself that I'm not putting in enough effort into the things I do? I already do a ton, and I've already burnt out this semester once. Or maybe that's just me trying to make excuses.

						<br><br>

						Some of the failures in my life have been eye-opening. From messing up talking to girls to failing to lift the weight when I'm going for a PR at the gym. Failures like these have meaning. Failures like these allow for me to push my limits.

						<br><br>

						These other failures aren't as a result of me pushing myself. They just kind of happen. It feels like with these failures that I can't be in control. I can't really control which professor I get. I can't control how heavy my workload gets.

						<br><br>

						There are ways to make the situation better. I could be better at time management. I could study more on my own. Sometimes it all becomes too much and I ask myself, "Is it worth it?"

						<br><br>

						Is it worth it to lose out on my happiness in order to prevent these failures? I could study constantly, but I'm sure as heck not going to be happy doing it. And then other times I try to put in the effort and I still fail anyway. What's the point? Why am I going through college with just over a 3.0 GPA? Why is it that every semester I'm worried if I'm going to pass my classes.

						<br><br>

						This stress seems almost unnecessary, but at the same time I don't see a way to get through my life without it. Maybe that's just one of the constants of life, though. Maybe it's impossible to go through life without all the stress.

						<br><br>

						Maybe this stress is what makes you a better person.

						<br><br>

						Sometimes though, I feel like I already have learned the lessons from these failures. I know what I have to do in the future, but sometimes I'm just not willing to do it. I'm not willing to sacrifice my happiness for grades. I have learned about how to manage stress, and how to cope. I've learned all of these life changing events in my life previously.

						<br><br>

						I just want a rest. I just want success to come easily. It's something that I've certainly fluctuated on before: taking the easy road in life. I've always opted for the difficult road because I believe that it makes me a better person and puts me in a better spot, but sometimes I question if it's the right road. I question if the sacrifices to my sanity that I'm making are worth it.

						<br><br>

						I know it'll end eventually. I hope it'll end eventually. I'm going to end this blog post now because I don't think I have this sorted out in my head yet.

						<br><br>

						I think I need to reevaluate what I'm doing. I know that failure is a good thing. I know that pushing yourself is a good thing. Yet, in the back of my mind, there's a little idea forming that it isn't worth it. Maybe that's what they call doubt. Maybe I'm doubting myself and I know that the doubt isn't actually something that I should listen to. I have confidence that I'm going down the right path, but that small little doubt keeps creeping into my head:

						"What's the point of all this failure? You aren't gaining from this failure. You're failing because you aren't good enough. You're just average. You've placed all these expectations onto yourself and you can't even complete any of them. Remember that 2 part post you made a few days ago about taking control? Yeah good luck doing that while I'm here."

						<br><br>

						Get out of my head, doubt.
