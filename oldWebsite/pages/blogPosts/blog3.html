					<h1>Thoughts on the Software Engineering Interview Process</h1>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						November 26, 2018.

						<br><br>

						So this website is meant to be a portfolio of sorts for me. It's meant to show off my projects and demonstrate my abilities in order to help me get a job. The blog is a secondary thing in mind with the website's focus. I figured, however, that I would make some of the blog posts about my thoughts on things in the tech industry. Why not, right?

						<br><br>

						Currently as I'm writing this post, I'm a sophomore in college, 19 years old. With this, I've been trying to obtain an internship so I have some professional coding experience. In fact, I want to obtain an internship so much, that I have applied to over 50 different companies. Some might say that I'm crazy. Others might say that I'm not applying to enough.

						<br><br>

						Personally, I'm apart of the club that thinks that job applications are mostly a numbers game. I think I need to apply more. Unfortunately, with school work and side projects, I seldom can find time to just keep applying. So this leads me to where I am now with all the companies that I've applied to.

						<br><br>

						I've received rejection emails from companies. I've received interview requests with companies that I haven't moved forward with. I've received interview requests with companies that I have moved forward with. I've received rejections.

						<br><br>

						Before all this began, I made sure to try to figure out and learn as much about the recruiting process as I can. I currently have a part time job doing IT support. I'm all about processes.

						<br><br>

						I went on /r/cscareersquestions, went to resume building sessions at my university, went to career fairs, worked on projects, worked a job during college even though it probably caused my grades to suffer. I've done almost everything I can do to prepare. The thing I've noticed with the process is that preparing doesn't just get you the job.

						<br><br>

						Preparing only helps you obtain the job. Sometimes, however, there is just going to be someone that is better than you. Sometimes the company just wants to hire Juniors or Seniors, and not Sophomores. Sometimes you do everything correct, but you just aren't the correct fit for the company, or maybe even the company isn't the best fit for you. It could be anything.

						<br><br>

						On /r/cscareersquestions I've noticed that the general community seems to not enjoy the process of getting a job. This makes sense; interviewing can be stressful. Sometimes it feels like your entire future rests upon getting this job. Sometimes if it's going poorly it feels as if you aren't succeeding. It's imposter syndrome when you don't even have a job.

						<br><br>

						This isn't why people are discontent with the process, however, it is more along the lines that companies interview you on things that hold no relevance to what you're actually going to do on the job. People think that the interview process is one that doesn't even screen for quality in the position.

						<br><br>

						I'm still new. I haven't had a coding job yet, so I can't really touch on how true this is. I have had 1 of the dreaded <i>technical interviews</i>. Wanna guess what company my very first technical interview was with?

						<br><br>

						Microsoft.

						<br><br>

						I think deep down I knew that the interview wasn't going to go anywhere. This was early in my application process, and when I received that email to schedule an on campus interview, I was ecstatic.

						<br><br>

						I didn't think that I was ready. Why did my first technical interview have to be with the company I wanted to work with the most? Why couldn't I have some real practice before the most important one. I really wanted the job though. Working at Microsoft would be a game changer. Sure it was only an internship, but an internship at one of the top 4 tech companies directly following your sophomore year is definitely something that recruiters notice on a resume. I thought that this would be the turning point for me.

						<br><br>

						This lead to probably my most stressful two weeks at college thus far. I didn't know what to expect, so I studied. I studied like I would for a test, but the difference was that I had no idea what I was going to be tested on. With school, you always know which sections will be on the test. With interviews, I could be tested on things that I haven't even learned in school yet.

						<br><br>

						I read through the beginning of Cracking the Coding Interview. I searched online for example interviews from big companies like Google. I went through /r/cscareersquestions and looked at what other people went through. I looked at questions to ask interviewers. I looked at sameple coding questions. I coded the solutions by hand. I went on HackerRank and LeetCode. I printed out tables of what I needed to study and taped them onto the walls of my room around my desk, so everything I needed was there constantly. I really wanted this internship.

						<br><br>

						The days leading up to it had a weird sense of calmness to them. I wasn't scared. I wasn't worried, or nervous. I was just existing. I think some people might refer to this as the calm before the storm, but little did I know was that I had almost no control in the storm arriving.

						<br><br>

						It was the day of the interview. I was confident. I was going to go in and crush the interview. I had done behavioral types of interviews before. I had done interviews before. I knew that I could crush those. The only thing that I was unsure about was that dang technical question. Would they take it easy on me because they know I'm only a sophomore? Would they ask me questions that require me to solve a problem, but have nothing coding related to them? They would definitely make me code, right?

						<br><br>

						Alright, I had nice clothes on. I freshened up and was ready to go. I started walking to the building where the interview would be. This is when the nervousness crept in. All that calmness that I had before finally showed that it wasn't calmness; it was nervousness hidden under a veil. That veil had finally removed itself, and the pressure set in.

						<br><br>

						I think most of the pressure was self inflicted. Like I said, I really wanted it. I wanted it so bad that I don't think I've wanted something else as much as this in my entire life. I'm sure though that my friends and family telling me such a big deal that an interview with Microsoft was didn't help either. There was pressure, but I was committed. I had worked under pressure before, and I wasn't going to allow it to stop me this time. Not today.

						<br><br>

						I arrived at the interview 10 minutes early. I would have to wait, so I did. I was sitting in the hallway next to another girl who had an interview. We were both silent. I noticed that she had brought a padfolio. I should have brought mine. How could I have forgotten something so simple? I had just brought a pen and dry erase marker. I was ready for the whiteboard interview. Why would I need to write down information to keep? Idiot.

						<br><br>

						I decided to break the ice with the girl. There was tension as we waited, and it was only making me more nervous. I asked the girl what position she was here for. An internship just like me. We were competing for the same position. She was a senior, however, that had switched majors. She wasn't computer science, or even software engineering like me. She was BioInformatics I think. She seemed even more nervous than me.

						<br><br>

						She said that her boyfriend had interviewed with Microsoft the previous day, and the boyfriend said that his interview was hard. 'Oh' was all I could say. I asked if she was nervous, and she said 'yeah.' I just replied with 'me too.'

						<br><br>

						Our conversation was cut short when her interviewer came out to get her. 'Good luck.' I said. I wonder if it helped. Then, I was alone.

						<br><br>

						And in crept the nervousness again. Hadn't I prepared? Why was I nervous? And then my interviewer walked out. It was a few minutes past when my interview was supposed to start. No big deal. I was about to get up when my interviewer said, 'Give me a minute.' and walked off toward the bathroom.

						<br><br>

						No big deal. I'm sure the interview will go fine. I'm sure of it.

						<br><br>

						He came back. We introduced ourselves, and I noticed something. I could hardly understand what he was saying. My interviewer had a thick Indian accent, and it was at that moment where I wasn't just nervous, I was scared. I had done all this preparation, and for what? For me to lose the opportunity all because I can't understand what this guy is saying?

						<br><br>

						I had no choice but to power through. The interview started. The questions weren't questions about my personality. They weren't the behavioral questions I had assumed would come up. No 'Why do you want to work here' or 'Tell me about a time where x happened...'

						<br><br>

						It was simply something along the lines of what programming classes have you taken. It was a question that didn't give me much room to elaborate. I have taken x classes and learned y, but in my free time I also do z. That was it. They just wanted to ask 'What do you know' without explicitly asking it.

						That took probably 5 minutes. I'm not sure because my biological clock was probably going haywire because of how fast my heart was beating. Then it was time for the technical question. In a 30 minute time frame I guess they didn't want to waste time with silly behavioral questions. They just wanted the meat. They wanted to see if I could code, and figuring out if they like me would come later.

						<br><br>

						"Given the memory location of a node in a linked list, deallocate the memory of the node"

						<br><br>

						That was my question, word for word. Of course at this moment I was thinking that it was over. Memory management in Java? I knew that pointers dealt with memory in C, but how do you deal with memory in Java? It looked like the question did end up being something I hadn't learned yet.

						<br><br>

						I knew what linked lists were, however, and I had prepared to not let questions stump me. If it seems confusing, there's probably a reason for that. What type of linked list is it? Double? Single? Single, ok, not what I was hoping for.

						<br><br>

						I knew what needed to be done, or at least I thought that I did. If I wanted to get rid of the memory for that node, I would need to remove it from the linked list. This was simple. I had removed a node from a linked list before. Just take the previous node and set the next of that to the next of the node being removed.

						<br><br>

						I ran into a problem though. How do I access the previous node. Am I given the firstNode of the list? No. Just the single node that can only go forward. Got it. How do I do this then? What was the crucial step that I was missing? Did the interviewer say something and I just couldn't understand him, so I missed out on important information?

						<br><br>

						I decided that I didn't want to just stand there so I told the interviewer I was going to first write it with pseudocode. As I said this he kind of cut me off saying something that went along the lines of, 'yes, yes, whatever.'

						<br><br>

						As I was writing, it almost seemed like the interviewer wasn't even paying attention. Was this real? I had prepared all this time to get an interviewer that didn't even care if I succeeded? I finished the pseudocode, and I had still yet to find a solution to my previous problem of having no access to the previous node.

						<br><br>

						I basically asked for a push in the right direction from the interviewer and he gave me this:

						<br><br>

						What if you take the data of the next node, and replace the data of the given node with that data, and then set the next to the next of that node?

						<br><br>

						Of course! While with this I still had the problem of deallocating memory, I could at least get rid of a node. The thought in the back of my head was that technically I wasn't deallocating the memory that I was given, I was deallocating the node afterwards.

						<br><br>

						I didn't think that this answer was correct, and I mentioned that to the interviewer, but he seemed to brush off what I said. Ok, I guess I would go to code it.

						<br><br>

						---<br>
						public void remove(Memory of Node) {<br>
						<br>
						}<br>
						---<br>

						<br><br>
							
						Wait what do I do with the memory location? You access memory in C with pointers, but how do you do that in Java? Why hadn't I paid more attention in the first week when we talked about this. I asked the interviewer. Just imagine it's something along the lines of 'Node n' or something.

						<br><br>

						Of course. The thing that was tripping me up was the memory part of the question. Now I had asked a basic question that made me look like I didn't know what I was doing. If the question had been "remove a node from a linked list" I'm sure that I would have been able to do it all on my own. Now, though, I seemed like an idiot.

						<br><br>

						I wrote the code, and even ran through some tests. As I was testing it, I noticed the interviewer not paying attention again. Whatever, I had gotten the question right, despite the question being worded terribly.

						<br><br>

						I asked if this was ok, and he said "Yes its fine" as if he didn't actually want to critique it, but rather just wanted to finish the interview. I was pretty much out of time. Where had the time gone? Shouldn't the interviewer have been pushing the interview to fit within the time frame? Whatever, I started a few minutes late anyway, so it's ok if I end a little late too.

						<br><br>

						We moved onto questions I had for the interviewer, and yeah I did have questions. I asked the interviewer what team he worked on, and then he answered by speaking 20 miles an hour. He was talking so fast that I could only pick out a few words here and there because they were recognizable words like "Outlook" or "team".

						<br><br>

						The interviewer just kept talking. He had answered my questions, but for some reason kept going in depth on specific things and how they work when they weren't really apart of the question in the first place. We were running out of time and I had more questions, but I wasn't getting anything useful from asking them. I couldn't understand what he was saying. This was a theme that was pretty constant throughout the interview, and at this point I just wanted it to be over with.

						<br><br>

						"How much time do we have left?" I asked. "Yes, yes, we are over time. The next interviewee is waiting!" he replied as if somehow blaming the fact that we went over on me.

						<br><br>

						I asked for a way I could reach out, and a time frame I should hear a response in. At first he told me I could find him on LinkedIn and message him there, but then he gave me his email. Of course I didn't understand what he said, so I guessed on the first half and asked if a specific letter at the end was a B or a V. I would have asked each letter, but he was already rushing me. I didn't really have a chance.

						<br><br>

						I was rushed out and as we shook hands he said to me, "I hope to one day see you in Redmond working with us." I joked and said "Well, that's up to you!" and laughed. That was a good sign. He said that he wanted to see me again.

						<br><br>

						I never heard from them again.

						<br><br>

						So that's my experience with the technical interview. Personally, I hated it. The interviewer wasn't friendly, the question was worded strangely, and I was hard pressed for time due to things out of my control. Maybe I could have solved the question a little faster. Maybe we could have started on time.

						<br><br>

						Some times things are just out of your control.

						<br><br>

						I hate how they get your hopes up. You think interviews go well, and then you never hear from the company again. They ghost you, and with companies, it puts you in a bad place because you just don't know what's going on. At least send me a rejection email. Don't just ignore me, please.

						<br><br>

						I guess I didn't really even talk about my thoughts on the process all that much. Maybe I'll have to do a part 2 of this topic in the future because this post is already very long. I've had other phone interviews and even requests for on site interviews that I didn't move forward with because they don't provide housing, which is one thing I'm looking for.

						<br><br>

						With all that said, I'm still looking for an internship. I'm still going to succumb to the process. Do I really have a choice?
