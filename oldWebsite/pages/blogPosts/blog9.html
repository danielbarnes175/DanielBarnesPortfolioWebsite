						<br><br>

						Of course it's all well and fun to SAY that I'm going to complete my mission. But I want to actually do it. I need a BATTLE PLAN in order to complete the mission. I need to identify my enemies and figure out a way to shoot them down.

						<br><br>

						That's what this post is about, identifying my obstacles.

						<br><br>

						<strong>1.</strong><br>
						I am lazy. I would rather go on the internet and browse random videos than get my work done. I have excuse after excuse about why I can't wait on doing something, but at the end of the day, that excuse means nothing.

						<br><br>

						<strong>2.</strong><br>
						I crave external validation. I want to feel wanted. I want others to like me as a person. I want people to know who I am. I want people to like my posts on social media. I want people to notice me.

						<br><br>

						But really what does that do? The only change it adds into my life is entirely superficial. It is worthless, but the media brainwashes you into thinking that it is one of the most important thing in the world. The most important thing is MY OPINION of myself. End of story.

						<br><br>

						<strong>3.</strong><br>
						I'm prioritize long term goals over the short term. This may seem like a good thing at first, but because of this, the short term goals are never getting completed! I keep pushing them off because I have to do things that I won't see the fruits of there efforts for YEARS.

						<br><br>

						Long term goals are good, don't get me wrong. It's just that they are LONG TERM; I have plenty of time to work on them. I need to do what makes me happy now because otherwise I crash and burn.

						<br><br>

						<strong>4.</strong><br>
						I lose focus. So many times something comes into my life unexpectedly and gets me down. When this happens I slump into a minor depression. Eventually I find my focus again and break out of it, but then the cycle repeats again two weeks later. This puts me in a constant state of changing from extreme happiness to extreme sadness or loneliness. This is something that I need to fix, and I'm not sure how I can prevent it just yet.

						<br><br>

						<strong>5.</strong><br>
						I waste time. I waste SO MUCH time doing things that do not benefit me at all. I need to eliminate things that don't improve my quality of life.

						<br><br>

						<strong>6.</strong><br>
						One thing that isn't something I can control, but nevertheless an obstacle is the actions of others. I wrote a blog post on this which you can find <a href="blog7.html">here</a>. Sometimes I can want to do something involving someone else, but unfortunately, they don't always want me.

						<br><br>
						
						<strong>7.</strong><br>
						I don't know enough. Sometimes I have a coding interview, and I just don't know what I need to know. I need to pursue knowledge, and not think of it as just a grind.

						<br><br>

						<strong>
						This list isn't complete. I have countless obstacles, and I need to keep a record of them here. This is the only way to complete my mission.
