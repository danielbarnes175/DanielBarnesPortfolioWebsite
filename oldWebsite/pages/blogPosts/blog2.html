					<h1>Feelings of Existence</h1>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						November 25, 2018.

						<br><br>
						
						This one will be a bit confusing for me to write about, for I've never really heard of someone experiencing the same thing. There's probably a word out there for the sense that I'm feeling, but right now, I am unsure as to what it could be.

						<br><br>

						It's this feeling when I'm doing something completely normal. I'm doing something that is just happening in my life, when suddenly it hits me that I am here right now. It hits me that I exist. Whenever it happens I say to myself, "This is me, I am here in this moment right now." I wonder why this feeling hits me. Why do I randomly just notice that I am alive in this world.

						<br><br>

						It's this sense of being apart of something bigger than yourself. It's the sense of how everything that has happened in your life has brought you to this moment. All the different experiences that you've gone through, all the people you've met, all the lives you may have impacted, have brought you to this one single moment. There's even a tree with the people that you've interacted with. There's the events, the people, and the experiences in their lives that have brought them to that moment where they interacted with you.

						<br><br>

						It's this impending feeling of dread, but also a feeling of wonder, and mystery. It makes you forget about all the things that are going on in your life. You are just stuck in the moment. It makes you wonder how the correct lumps of proteins have formed to bring you to this very second in time.

						<br><br>

						Is it fate? Is there truly some unknown force out there driving who lives and who dies? Is there a force that pushes and pulls until everyone is where they need to be? Why did things turn out the way that they did? Was it your choices? Was it your fault?

						<br><br>

						There's this sense that you are just one being in a whole word of complex organisms. It's a sense that people tend to forget. It's a sense that makes me wonder if it is actually some sort of survival mechanism coded into the human genome through millions of years of evolution in order to keep us alive.

						<br><br>

						In moments like these, I look at those that surround me, and it makes me wonder. What has happened in these people's lives? Surely they've laughed. Surely they've cried. Surely they aren't too different than me?

						<br><br>

						Right?

						<br><br>

						It brings a feeling of humanity. It brings a feeling of existence. It brings a feeling of being a small piece in a large puzzle. A small fish in a big pond. A feeling that I can't describe as being empty, or being completely whole.

						<br><br>

						I can't tell with this feeling. I can't tell why this feeling exists. Don't all feelings have purpose? Aren't they all chemicals trying to tell your brain something? What are these moments trying to tell my brain? That I'm alive?

						<br><br>

						Is it that I exist? When these moments happen it's as if I am hyper aware of everything going around me. Nothing matters, and yet everything matters at the same time.

						<br><br>

						Sometimes I wonder. Do other people have these moments? Have we gotten so engrossed in the technology of today's world that nobody ever has time to stop and think? Is that why these moments are forced upon me seemingly out of nowhere?

						<br><br>

						What are these feelings of existence?
