					<h1>Confidence</h1>
					<p class="p-blog-post">
						February 2, 2019

						<br><br>

						You know, lately I've been having some discussions with people. "I'm not confident enough," they say, or "I'm too scared of messing up."

						<br><br>

						They often dismiss advice that tells them to be more confident with claims such as "It isn't that simple," or "I can't just flip a switch and suddenly be confident."

						<br><br>

						It's a fair argument. Nobody is able to just flip a switch and change a part of who they are. The thing is they miss the point.

						<br><br>

						So if you're ever trying to improve your confidence, keep reading. If you're afraid of making the first step, but you are open to change, then keep reading. If you'll keep thinking that your situation is special and that for some reason you're different, then leave. Confidence is something that everyone can cultivate, but you have to want to change. You have to want to change.

						<br><br>

						So how do I actually become confident? Well, it's simple: start doing things that you are unconfortable with. Start moving outside of your comfort zone. Take risks. Do things that you normally don't do.

						<br><br>

						That's literally it. This is usually the part where the "it's not that simple" claims come in. No, it is that simple.

						<br><br>

						It is that simple because the only way to grow is through failure. I'm not saying that simply stepping outside of your comfort zone will make you confident. No, that would be silly.

						<br><br>

						It is the <strong><em>PROCESS</em></strong> that will make you confident. From doing things that you are afraid of doing, you get better at doing them.

						<br><br>

						You keep doing things, bit by bit, that you are not confident with, and you keep getting better at doing them. When you get better and better, you get more confident in doing them. You keep pushing to make it harder because when you do something harder than what you did before, then what you did before is simple in comparison.

						<br><br>

						It is going to be tough. It is going to be hard. Those first steps in doing something you are uncomfortable with are the worst.

						<br><br>

						The great thing is that it keeps getting easier. Perhaps your journey will take longer than another person's journey. When you cultivate this skill over years, however, you can look back and think, man I can't believe I didn't want to do that. I can't believe I struggled asking that girl for her number. I can't believe I struggled to ask a question in my class.

						<br><br>

						It isn't just a switch that you can flip and be confident. The switch comes from whether or not you actually do it. The onus is on you. You can choose to take the steps outside of your comfort zone, or you can make every excuse in the world about why you can't. Maybe the situation isn't perfect, maybe you haven't done enough planning. Here's the secret: it's never going to be perfect. It's never going to go how you planned.

						<br><br>

						That's just a fact of life. The sooner that you accept that you will fail, the sooner that you will succeed. The process takes time, and the longer you continue to mess around trying to find a way to improve without struggling, the longer you will suffer. It's a catch 22, you have to suffer in order to stop suffering.

						<br><br>

						"I'm not confident" you say. So then I reply.

						<br><br>

						What are you going to do about it?
